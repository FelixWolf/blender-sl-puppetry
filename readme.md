# Plywood Cube

## What is this?
Blender add-on to do things with Second Life

## What does it do?
Currently it creates a Second Life skeleton that can be used for rigging/animation. 
As well as support for puppetry streaming.

## What is planned?
* Anim Import/Exporting
* Native mesh format exporting
* Mesh pack exporting(Scene export as a .zip file with native meshes)
* Ability to add texture assets (IF you have the UUID for it, basically a short-cut to save as...)
